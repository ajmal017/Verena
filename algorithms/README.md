# Algorithms

Check out [davidcgong.com](https://davidcgong.com) to read about other strategies that I haven't published here. Currently I use a low-frequency CAPM asset pricing model algorithm with some modifications (technical and fundamental statistical analysis)

The algorithms here are pretty simple and are at best good for some soft experimentation
