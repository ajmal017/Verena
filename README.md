# StockVis

## Finding a way to better visualize the stock market and possible predictions in Python using ML/DL/NLP

Currently competing in [Two Sigma: Using News to Predict Stock Movements](https://www.kaggle.com/c/two-sigma-financial-news/data), goal is to obtain NLP implementation knowledge and apply it to this project. Also maybe to win some money :)


## Currently supports:
#### - Linear Regression
#### - LSTM Neural Network (kind of) in Tensorflow

## Working On:
#### - Improving LSTM Neural Network
#### - Natural Language Processing for news headlines/tweets using Chainer framework
#### - Measuring performance differences between Tensorflow and Keras
