## Currently supports:
#### - Linear Regression
#### - LSTM Neural Network in Tensorflow

## Working On:
#### - Changing the name of this project
#### - Improving LSTM Neural Network
#### - Natural Language Processing for news headlines/tweets using Chainer framework
##### - Currently competing in [Two Sigma: Using News to Predict Stock Movements](https://www.kaggle.com/c/two-sigma-financial-news/data), goal is to obtain NLP implementation knowledge and apply it to this project. 
#### - Measuring performance differences between Tensorflow and Keras

## Plans:
#### - C++
#### - Possible FOREX/cryptocurrency support as well
#### - Web application
#### - Mobile application?
