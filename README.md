## Finding a way to better visualize the stock market and possible predictions in Python using ML/DL/NLP

The goal of this project is to better understand the application of artificial intelligence techniques in the financial market.

Though, I think I kind of swapped to doing algorithmic trading instead. Will post algorithms and blog posts in the future

## Currently doing:
#### - Testing various models and strategies on QuantConnect

## Done:
#### - Linear Regression
#### - LSTM Neural Network in Tensorflow
